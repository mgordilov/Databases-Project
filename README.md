# Databases-Project

This website is designated for the food lovers. For the people who like to cook and to try something new each day.

It comes with an empty database which will remember thousands (hopefully, and millions) of receipt all over the world, published by our 
beloved users.

All the users can also leave reviews for all the recipes they see on the website. For all the action the login is required, but the process
of creating an account is super-fast and intuitive.

Hope you'll enjoy it!

P.S.: All the receipts require an image. In order to save an image, you will need to use a host service to store your image and use it on our website in the form of the generated link. That's why, I would kindly ask you to access the next page before saving an image, uploading it, copying the "Direct link" and pasting it into the respective field on the website. Here's the site:

Thanks for your attention!
